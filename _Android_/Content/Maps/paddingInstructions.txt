Tilset packing instructions:

1). Import to gimp --> Filtering --> Tilesets, Padding: 1 Spacing: 1

2). Create new tilset in tiled, margin: 1 spacing: 3

Note: Order in which tilesets are added to tiled maps is important. Background must be loaded in first,then foreground. If order gets messed up
do --> remove tilesets from map --> Map --> Add external tilesets --> add in correct order
